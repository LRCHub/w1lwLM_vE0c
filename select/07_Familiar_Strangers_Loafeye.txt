Like a walk down a dead-end street
Like a ship sailed and lost at sea
We can hold out and clutch at a straw
But I don't even know you anymore

Like the curtain at the end of the show
Like the sound of a lonesome whistle blow
We can make believe it's worth fighting for
But I don't even know you anymore

Cause we're just familiar strangers
We don't know any better
Oh why do we hold our breath and wait
When it's too late?

Like the answer to a question no one asked
Like a race where everybody comes in last
We will end up on the cutting room floor
Cause I don't even know you anymore

Cause we're just familiar strangers
We don't know any better
Oh why do we hold our breath and wait
Cause we're just familiar strangers
We don't know any better
Oh why do we hold our breath and wait
When it's too late?
When it's too late?
