In your basement, i grow cold
Thinking back to what i was always told
Don't talk to strangers or you might fall in love
Freezer bride, your sweet divine
You devour like smoked bovine hide
How funny, i never considered myself tough

You're so handsome, walking over to me now

I tried to be good
Am i no good
Am i no good
Am i no good
With my memory restricted to a polaroid in evidence
I just wanted to be yours
Can i be yours
Can i be yours
Can i be yours
If i'm turning in your stomach and i'm making you feel sick

When my mother sees me on the side
Of a milk carton in winn-dixie's dairy aisle
She'll cry
And wait up for me
We'll make love in your attic all night
Euphoric in some strange delight
I'm happier here cause he told me i should
Be

You're so handsome when i'm all over your mouth

I tried to be good
Am i no good
Am i no good
Am i no good
With my memory restricted to a polaroid in evidence
I just wanted to be yours
Can i be yours
Can i be yours
Can i be yours
If i'm turning in your stomach and i'm making you feel sick

I tried to be good
But i'm too good
Am i too good
Was i so good
When you chewed me up and shit me out like every bitch you're done with
