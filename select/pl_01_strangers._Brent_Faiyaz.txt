I vowed to keep you warm
I held you in my arms
And I tried my best to be a man
through it all
Even though it don't look like
it's in the plan anymore
I won't explain a damn thing
Baby, you were supposed to change
your last name
And then it all came crashing down
(Oh-woah)
You were supposed to hold it down
And I was supposed to be there in the end
As your lover and a friend,
but I just got one question
Is this something I did?
(Baby; to us?)
What happened?
Oh, baby
Don't know who we are right now
What's so different from back then?
I don't know who we are right now
I told you everything,
you told me parts of you
(Yeah)
You gave me hell to pay,
and I gave my heart to you
If that's the exchange,
then I'm making a change,
it's no hope in that
If it ain't the same,
better off we're estranged,
why hold me back?
(Hold me back)
Things I heard, I can't unhear
Things I saw won't disappear
Chips are down just like your tears
We were solid through the years
And then it all came crashing down
(Oh-woah)
You were supposed to hold it down
And I was supposed to be there in the end
As your lover and a friend,
and I still got one question
Is it something I did?
(I don't know what happened to us, baby)
What happened?
Oh, baby
Don't know who we are right now
What's so different from back then?
I don't know who we are right now
Note to self, be truthful,
even when it hurts
Make love and pray often,
eat healthy
Never reveal your true financial status
Read lots of books
Add color to everything you touch
And give without expecting anything in return
